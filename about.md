My name is Avi Singh. I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, where I am advised by [Prof. Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/). I graduated from IIT-Kanpur in June 2016, with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering. 

You can find more about me on my academic [webpage](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~avisingh/).
