<!--<span class="red">**News:**</span> Paper accepted to ICRA 2016!-->

<!--My research interests are in Machine Learning, and a lot my work is motivated by applications in Robotics and Computer Vision.-->

I graduated from [IIT-Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in) in June 2016, earning a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.

In Summer 2016, I was a research intern in the [Machine Learning and Perception Lab](https://mlp.ece.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech, and worked under the [Prof. Dhruv Batra](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~dbatra/) and [Prof. Devi Parikh](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/).

In Summer 2015, I was a research intern in the [Robot Learning Lab](http://pr.cs.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University, and worked under [Prof. Ashutosh Saxena](http://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/asaxena/index.html) and [Ashesh Jain](http://www.asheshjain.org) on the [Brain4Cars](http://www.brain4cars.com) project. <!--Check out the [research]({{site.url}}/research) page of this website to find out more about my work, or scroll down to the [publications](#pubs) section of this page.-->

<!--I am passionate about technology, and erstwhile led the [Electronics Club](http://students.iitk.ac.in/eclub/) of IIT-Kanpur. I have given lectures to audiences of 400+ people, organized workshops and competitions, and mentored freshmen and sophomores through technical [projects](http://students.iitk.ac.in/eclub/projects_14.html).--> I love explaining things in a simpler manner, and have a [blog]({{site.url}}/blog) on this website, apart from authoring guest posts at places like [LearnOpenCV](http://www.learnopencv.com).<!-- I have also given a talk about my work at the [Special Interest Group in Machine Learning (SIGML)](http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/sigml/) at IIT-Kanpur. I love open-source, and try to release as much code as I can on my [github](https://github.com/avisingh599).-->
